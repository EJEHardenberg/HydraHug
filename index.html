			Hydra Hug is a simple twitter application that enables one to share
			friends lists. Let's say that you've been on twitter for a while and
			you invite a friend on.
		</p>
		<p>
			The friend, being a twitter newbie, doesn't know who to follow but
			they know that they like all your friends and have similar interests.
			So you take the following steps.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Click the <a href="/makelist.php">Make your list</a> link and authorize twitter
			</li>
			<li>
				Grab the link to your list and share it with your friend
			</li>
			<li>
				Your friend visits the link, authorizes twitter, and then the app
				will start connecting them to your list.
			</li>
			<li>
				You both enjoy twitter together!
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Privacy and Data Policy</h3>
		<p>
			As you can see by the <a href="https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/HydraHug">Source Code</a>
			the application only saves the bare minimum of data to link the lists
			together and do its work.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are no plans to use your data in anyway besides the above specified
			besides possibly reporting how many people have used the application. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The lists of who you follow will <strong>not</strong> be disclosed to 
			outside partys (who could just look at your twitter page anyway)
