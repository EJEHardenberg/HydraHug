HYDRA HUG
====================================

    Cut off one head, two more shall grow

Hydra Hug is a simple Twitter Application that lets a User share their
friends with other users. Its usecase is as follows:

- You're on twitter for a while, and a friend mentions wanting to join
- They're new to Twitter but know that you're friends with their friends
- They're lazy and don't want to click follow on all of them and search
  for them, etc.
- You export your friend list and share it with them, the app follows
  them all for you. 
- you both are now connected to each other and can happily share with
  each other. 

Sharing is caring!
